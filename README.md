# govpositions

Overview
--------
**govpositions** is a collection of functions for calculating party positions from the Manifesto Corpus data from existing and new, user-defined scales, and for aggregating the party positions into government positions and time series.

You can consult a detailed tutorial on using the **govposition** functions [here](http://dimiter.eu/Data_files/gov_positions/government_positions_from_party_data.html) 

Data preparation
---------
To use the functions, you need to load, align, and merge several datasets: the Manifesto Corpus, containing coded party manifestos, and two datasets from ParlGov that contain data on the duration and composition of governments.
